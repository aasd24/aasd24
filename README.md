### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm aasd24. I usually play games, but recently I've been into programming and the computer nerdy-stuff. 

### ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning:

I'm currently learning Python, haven't made a lot of projects yet, but making good progress so far.

I've also started learning the Bash Terminal on Linux, i've made a password generator that automatically saves the password into a .txt file..!
Doesn't sound exciting, but baby steps!

### ðŸ”­ Projects im working on / helping with:

I'm currently helping [@mini-bomba](https://github.com/mini-bomba), with his Enderman Bot on Discord. you can invite the bot by clicking [here!](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=676496144800415746&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdQw4w9WgXcQ&response_type=code&scope=bot)

### âœ¨ What I want to accomplish in 2021:

- I want to understand Python a lot better than last year, and start a bigger project. (and be a lot more helpful with the Enderman Bot, lol)
- I want to be a lot more familiar with Linux.
- I want to start learning C# (or C++, not sure yet), and make my first basic game in Unity.
