### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm an IT student that enjoys playing games and programming.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning:

- I'm currently learning Python. Started making a project, which i'll maybe publish on GitHub soon. ðŸ‘€
- I'm learning the basics of the Bash Terminal on Linux.

### ðŸ”­ Stuff I did:

- I helped [@mini-bomba](https://github.com/mini-bomba), with his Enderman Bot on Discord. You can invite the bot by clicking [here!](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=676496144800415746&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdQw4w9WgXcQ&response_type=code&scope=bot)

### âœ¨ My current goals:

- I want to publish my first project made in Python,
- I want to get more familiar with Linux,
- I want to launch my first website.
